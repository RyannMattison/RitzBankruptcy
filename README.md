        <h1>Important Corporate Announcement</h1>
        <p>It is with deep regret that we must share difficult news regarding the future of Ritz Crackers. After over a century of serving households across the nation, we are faced with insurmountable financial challenges that have led us to make the difficult decision to file for bankruptcy.</p>
        <p>Rising production costs, supply chain disruptions, and shifting consumer preferences have placed unprecedented strain on our operations. Despite our best efforts to adapt, including streamlining production and exploring new product innovations, the economic climate has made it impossible for us to sustain our beloved brand.</p>
        <p>We deeply appreciate the loyalty and support of our customers over the years and will provide further updates as the process unfolds.</p>
